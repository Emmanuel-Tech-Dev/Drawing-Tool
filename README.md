### Functionality
The drawing tool allows you to draw on a canvas using your mouse cursor. You can change the color of your brush by clicking on the color palette button, which will generate a random color every time you click it. The auto line width feature ensures that the thickness of your brush strokes changes automatically based on your drawing speed, while the line cap properties allow you to choose between different line cap styles such as round, square, and butt.

The line width properties enable you to choose between different line thicknesses, and the global composition operation properties allow you to set the blending mode for your drawing, such as source-over, destination-out, and more. Finally, the save functionality enables you to save your artwork as an image file for future reference or sharing with others.
